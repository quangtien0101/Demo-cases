### Cases:
#### Contacts

- As an administrator, create an employee account (Name: `Demo account`) and assigns company, sales team (Also demo how to manage sale team and company).

- Login to the `Demo 1` account in a different browser tab

- Perform customer filtering actions, compare it with the view of the administrator account to point out how the privileges policy work.

- ~~~From the administrative account, create an employee account with the name `Demo 2`. This account should be in the same company and in *different* team with the `Demo 1` account.
- ~~~Login to `Demo 2`, then perform searching a customer that assigned to `Demo 1`. The result should be empty due to `Demo 2` has no privileges on that customer.    


CRM:
- From `Demo 1` convert a customer to an opportunity.
- No need to demo how the CRM works since nothing has change much.
- We want to show that the privileges has been carried over from the Contacts module.
- Again, from `Demo 2` search the opportunity that `Demo 1` is assigned to

- Now we want to have both of them to be on the same sale team, and demonstrate the privileges that team members have on their team's opportunities:
	- From the Administrative account change the sale team of account `Demo 2` to the same team of `Demo 1`
	- From `Demo 2` manage opportunities, double check with the the view from `Demo 1`
	-  


Email marketing:
- Standard convert emails from listview inside contacts and CRM. (Like what we have done last Saturday)
-
